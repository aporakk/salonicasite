		<h1>Monuments</h1>
		<p>Among the numerous monuments of particular interest in the city are those from the Roman period, the Triumphal Arch of Galerius (<a href="photos/kamara_big.gif">Kamara</a>) and the Rotonda. Thessaloniki is, however, above all famous for its Byzantine period, being second only to Constantinople itself. Its many churches whose fine mosaics and wall-paintings are representative of various periods of Byzantine art have survive to enhance the image of the city. One of the most beautiful church is that of Agia Sofia (<a href="photos/ag_sofia_big.gif">Ag. Sofia</a>). Large sections of the city-walls (<a href="photos/kastra_big.gif">Kastra</a>) are also still standing, together with one of their main bastions, the well-known White Tower (<a href="photos/lefkos_big.gif">Lefkos Pyrgos</a>).</p>
		<h1>Other places to visit</h1>
		<p>For a combination of shopping and sightseeing we recomment you visit Navarinou str (<a href="photos/navarinou_big.gif">Navarinou</a>) and Vardaris Square (<a href="photo/vardalis_big.gif">Vardaris</a>). In addition you may enjoy a walk on the famous Aristotelous str (<a href="photo/aristotelous_big.gif">Aristotelous</a>).</p>
		<p>For a more cultural outing try to book a seat at the Macedonian Study Theater (<a href="photo/theatre_big.gif">Theatre</a>), or if it is Early September that you visit the city, visit the Helexpo (<a href="photo/ekthesi_big.gif">Ekthesi</a>).</p>
